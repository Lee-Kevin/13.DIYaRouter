Sometimes, I would like to know if anyone use my network without my permission, and I’m curious on how many devices are connected to my router. So I made this DIY router and share this project to you. If this project is useful to you, don’t forget to share on SNS.

I used a RGB LED Strip to indicate the network status. For example, the led color as the picture below shows represent net speed.

The number of green led as the picture shows indicates how many devices has connected to the router.
